That's an application initially generated with the command:

<pre>
  rails dm_rails3_app -m http://github.com/snusnu/rails-templates/raw/master/dm_rails_master.rb
</pre>

I had to add / modify a couple of things to get it the spec passes.

Added:

<pre>
  ActionController::Base.allow_forgery_protection = false
</pre>

to config/environments/test.rb.

Added:

<pre>
  :persisted? => true
</pre>

to the view specs in order to make polymorphic\_url treat the objects as saved objects (new\_record? == false).
