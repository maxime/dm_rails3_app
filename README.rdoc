= dm_rails3_app

That's an application initially generated with the command:

  rails dm_rails3_app -m http://github.com/snusnu/rails-templates/raw/master/dm_rails_master.rb

I had to add / modify a couple of things to get it the spec passes.

Added:

  ActionController::Base.allow_forgery_protection = false

to config/environments/test.rb.

Added:

  :persisted? => true

to the view specs in order to make polymorphic_url treat the objects as saved objects (new_record? == false).
